## Sports Analytics: Predicting likelihood of player injuries (Original goal)
## Predicting if a player would be out a certain number of days (New goal)
## The data is for the NFL and was sourced from kaggle

During a Future Mindset Challenge organized by my school (Hult Int'l Business School), I was tasked to develop a business idea and back it up with relevant code and the time frame for this challenge was 5 days. I decided to go into sports analytics where my goal was to predict the likelihood of a player getting injured based on their training data and in-game data. Due to the limited time frame, I wasn't able to get data containing most of my preferred features and I had to pivot to a new goal which was now to predict if an injured player would be out a certain number of days based on the data available. 
That not withstanding, the files labeled prototype 1 and 2 is an example of how the application would look like if more research is carried out to create an effiecient data collection pipeline.
